# Lecture slides overview

## What is a graph
- What are graphs/networks?
  - vertices & edges
- Examples of connectomes
  - humans: vertices = brain regions; edges = connection strength
  - dros: vertices = neurons; edges = synapses

## Models

### Statistical model
- Generative model -> parameters -> inference task

### Biological model
- One of the things Pedigo talked about

### No model
- How to define? (Computing graph features?)

## Why statistical models
- Is good

## Why not other "models"
- Graph features are bad
- Figure of different graph with same features

## SBM as an example
- What are parameters?
- How do we estimate parameters?

## Drosophila as an example
- Drosophila examples fitted as SBMs
- Figures of fits

## What more slides?
