# ndworkshop19

## Notes from 2019 Workshop

- Let's prepare people better, specifically:  
  - Clarify that in the afternoon, we want to be working on their data
  - This requires us having fixed specs for each day's analysis, which we'd need to codify at a minimum, a few months in advance
  - Let's tell them that everything will be in python, and encourage them to install all the requisite packages for each day *prior* to attending, which would include:
    - SciPy: for mgc
    - Scikit-learn: for sporf
    - Networkx: for graspy
    - DiPy: for ndmg
    - Scikit-image: for reg
- Let's get a block of hotel rooms at the double, and recommend that for them
- How many days should it be? 
  - maybe only 4 days, almost everyone left by friday?
  - maybe day 4 is the combo: big data pipelines, including ndmg-d, ndmg-f, & reg, 
  - maybe day 5 is big data storage/management/visualization?
- Maybe i should give every talk? let's get feedback on the talk quality?
- Maybe we should get explicit funding for this, we could easily get up to $100k from NSF i would think.
